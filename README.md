## Stockholm metro
### The situation description
During August-September 2018 each day I got up from my bed at ~7:50 and went to Sk√§rholmen station of metro. I left the house at about 8:20, but I never took a look at my clock after alarm rang. The length of path to metro is 10-12 minutes. The interval between trains is 10 minutes (at this time on working days; weekend was excluded, if I occassionally slept too much and didn't arrive at the station when trains interval was still 10 minutes, I missed the measurement). I went underground and took a look at the clock that shows how many minutes is left before the next train (the number is from 9 to 0), and wrote down this number.
### Possible tasks
1. Is my morning independent from timetable of trains? My feeling is that I didn't think about timetable at all. But is it true? 
2. I usually used one of 2-3 trains (something like 8:30, 8:40, 8:50, 9:00), but I didn't write down which train I used. Is it possible to recover this information?
